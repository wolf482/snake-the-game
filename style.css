Thank you for confirming the repave was done as a vanilla OpenShift cluster. However, since the repave, several pods (e.g., [list names if known]) are crashing repeatedly, degrading cluster performance. These issues began immediately after the repave, suggesting they may stem from:

Base components included in the vanilla setup but misconfigured.

Residual artifacts from the repave process.

Key Observations:

CrashLoopBackOff pods (see attached logs/screenshots).

Degraded performance risks long-term instability.

Request:

Could you verify if these crashing pods are required for baseline operations?

If not, can we cleanly remove them? If yes, they need proper configuration.

If the cluster wasnâ€™t fully cleaned, I recommend a remediated repave to avoid recurring issues.
