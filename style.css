Regarding the yarn.lock issue in the init container during migration, I’ve identified a fix: we can modify the container’s command to include rm -rf yarn.lock before executing the installation script. Here’s the tested solution:

yaml
command:  
  - /bin/sh  
  - -c  
  - "rm -rf yarn.lock && ./install-dynamic-plugins.sh /dynamic-plugins-root"
