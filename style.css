Orchestrator Project Platform Alignment Proposal
Based on the scope document and your concerns, here's how I recommend aligning platform tasks with the developer requirements:

Current Situation
The lead developer has created a scope document for an orchestrator project using SonataWorkflows

Platform requirements weren't initially included in the scope

Your manager is making last-minute platform requests without proper planning

You want to proactively include platform tasks with proper timelines

Recommended Actions
1. Immediate Meeting Request
Request a meeting with:

Lead developer

Your manager

Any other relevant stakeholders

2. Scope Document Additions to Propose
Platform Requirements Section:

Platform Requirements

1. RHDH Environment Setup in iLab:
   - Components required:
     * Orion-backend
     * Openshift-services
     * CMP-services
     * RHDH
   - Estimated timeline: [X weeks]
   - Dependencies: [list any]

2. CICD Workflows Implementation:
   - Mirror Artifactory dependencies
   - Pipeline configuration
   - Estimated timeline: [Y weeks]

3. Additional Platform Support:
   - [List any other anticipated needs]
Implementation Plan Updates:

Add platform tasks with dependencies clearly marked

Include realistic timelines for platform work

3. Timeline Management Strategy
Document all current platform requests with effort estimates

Present these in the meeting with developer timelines

Negotiate priorities if there are conflicts

Establish a process for future platform requests:

Minimum lead time requirements

Change request process

Regular sync points between dev and platform teams

4. Communication Approach
In the meeting, frame this as:

Ensuring project success by identifying all requirements early

Preventing last-minute surprises that could delay the project

Creating visibility into platform needs for better planning

Would you like me to draft a specific email to request this meeting or create more detailed timeline estimates based on your knowledge of these tasks?
