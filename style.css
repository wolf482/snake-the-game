@Jyotirmay Thanks for handling the repave. To help us stabilize the cluster, could you please:

Verify the repave is fully clean - Confirm no pods are crashing after the process completes

Clean up any remaining issues - Help us identify and remove any stuck/crashed pods from the old deployment

Validate cluster health - Ensure core components are stable before handover
