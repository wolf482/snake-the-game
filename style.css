I’d appreciate your expertise to review and optimize our RHDH entity ingestion, focusing on:

Current Workflow

Validate polling-based ingestion (via processingInterval) vs. webhook-triggered updates.

Key tradeoffs:

Polling intervals: Balance freshness (frequency: {minutes: 10}) vs. load.

Webhooks: Immediate updates (if configured).

Database impact: Scans query/update backstage_plugin_catalog tables.

Improvements

Custom processors for metadata enrichment/validation.

Scalability tuning for Bitbucket/GitHub providers.

Next Steps

Sync to review configs/logs (I’ve prepared samples).

Test PoCs (e.g., shorter intervals for critical repos).

Let me know your availability.
