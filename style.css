Thank you for your feedback. I’d like to clarify that I had verbally communicated my planned vacation during our team standup meetings well in advance, as early as [mention specific date or timeframe if possible]. At that time, the absence calendar had not yet been implemented, and the focus was on the ongoing UAT and certification progress for the RHDH migration, which has kept the team heavily occupied.

I acknowledge that updating the calendar formally was delayed, as I was awaiting confirmation from Rajesh regarding the project’s status before finalizing my plans. However, I ensured the team was aware of my intentions early on. Moving forward, I’ll ensure all approvals and calendar updates are completed promptly to avoid any miscommunication.

Regarding client approval, I’ll coordinate with Rajesh and the relevant stakeholders to address this promptly. I appreciate your understanding as we navigate this busy phase of the project.
