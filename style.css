No, I havenâ€™t made any changes to the operator pipeline in the ilab02d cluster. I only gained access recently and have been focused on [mention your actual task, e.g., â€˜reviewing documentationâ€™ or â€˜onboardingâ€™].

If thereâ€™s an issue with the cluster, letâ€™s troubleshoot it togetherâ€”please share specifics (logs, timestamps, or error messages) so I can help investigate. Otherwise, Iâ€™d suggest checking recent deployment histories or audit logs to identify the actual root cause.

Thanks for flagging, but letâ€™s ensure we base our concerns on data moving forward. ðŸ˜Š"
