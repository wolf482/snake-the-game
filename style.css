Hi Vineet,

I wanted to provide some clarity regarding the migration from 1.4 to 1.5. The process was fully completed, including the deployment of the latest plugin code, app configurations, and secrets. However, we did identify that two config values were missing in the app config file, which likely triggered the NotImplementedError. This was not due to an initial setup oversight but rather an oversight in the config validation during migration.

I’ve since rectified the missing values, and the system is now functioning as expected. If you or the team notice anything else during validation, please let me know—I’m happy to address any concerns promptly.
