Thanks, Rajashree, for proposing the dual-secret injection approach. To refine this further:

Short-Term (Migration Phase):

Agree on sourcing both secrets during startup, but with strict validation to ensure parity (e.g., checksum comparison or automated alerts on mismatch).

Document a clear rollback plan if inconsistencies arise.

Long-Term (Post-Migration):

As Rajashree noted, weâ€™ll consolidate to RHDH secrets once migration is complete. This should include:

Deprecation timeline for Orion secrets.

Audit trails to confirm no legacy dependencies remain.
