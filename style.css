Dear ,

I hope this email finds you well. I’d like to formally inform you of my upcoming vacation from July 15 to August 15, 2025. As we’re in the middle of the migration, I’ve ensured the following backup coverage to minimize disruptions:

Orchestrator:  will handle my responsibilities.

RHDH Migration:  will be the primary backup, with Rajeshdree and Bippin as additional supports.

Keycloak:  will oversee these tasks in my absence.

I’ll ensure all pending work is documented and transitioned smoothly before my leave. For urgent matters, Mohamed (cc’d) will be the point of contact, with Arun and Joshoua supporting their respective areas.

I appreciate your understanding and want to reiterate my commitment to this project. That said, I’ll be fully offline during my leave to recharge, and I trust the team to manage in my absence. I’ll reconnect on my return to ensure a seamless transition back.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
Platform Lead
