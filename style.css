Dear Katerina,

Thank you for reaching out. Upon reviewing the request, weâ€™ve confirmed that the package in question (Node.js 18.17.1, CTC Product ID 40733) was removed from the system some time ago, and the CAS records have since been refreshed.

To ensure accuracy, we will re-run the report tomorrow and provide you with the updated results. This will help clarify any discrepancies and confirm the current status.

Please let us know if you require any additional details in the meantime.
