ppreciate the clean slate repave! ðŸš€ Noticed a few pods seem to be stuck in a reboot loop since the refreshâ€”likely hitchhikers from the base setup or maybe some leftovers.

Quick ask:

Are these crashy pods ([names]) part of the vanilla package?

If theyâ€™re needed, might need a config tweak. If not, we can probably evict them.

Either way, letâ€™s squash this before it becomes a bigger thing. Happy to hop on a quick call if it helps.
