Subject: Session Expiration Handling Issue in Red Hat Developer Hub (RHUB) 1.5

Product: Red Hat Developer Hub (RHUB)
Version: 1.5

Issue Description:
When a user is logged into Red Hat Developer Hub (RHUB) and the session token expires, the following problems occur:

No Pre-Expiration Warning:

There is no alert or notification to inform the user that their session is about to expire due to inactivity.

No Redirect on Session Expiration:

After the session expires (due to inactivity), the user is not automatically redirected to the login page. Instead, the UI displays an error on the main page without proper handling.

Error Displayed:

The error observed is: "Failed to load entity kinds" (see attached screenshot). This is misleading and does not indicate session expiration, leading to a poor user experience.

Expected Behavior:

Users should receive a warning (e.g., a pop-up or notification) before session expiration.

Upon token/session expiration, users should be redirected to the login page for re-authentication.

Errors related to session expiry should be user-friendly and actionable.

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in to RHUB 1.5.

Remain inactive until the session token expires.

Observe the lack of pre-expiration warnings.

After expiration, note the error on the main page instead of a redirect to login.

Attachments:

Screenshot of the error ("Failed to load entity kinds") after session expiration.

Request:
Please assist in resolving this issue or provide guidance on configuring session management (e.g., timeout alerts, redirects) in RHUB 1.5.
