Hi Team,

To prevent potential breakpoints, we need to ensure that any updates to Orion secrets are immediately mirrored in RHDH. This includes:

Automated checks (if possible) or manual validation post-deployment.

Documentation of changes to maintain traceability.

Alert mechanisms to flag discrepancies during deployments.

Next Steps:

Confirm if current CI/CD pipelines include cross-validation for secrets.

Designate owners for Orion/RHDH secret synchronization (or propose a shared checklist).

Letâ€™s discuss in the next standup or a quick sync to align on the process. Open to suggestions on streamlining this further.
