@Jyotirmay – Thanks for the update. A few concerns after the repave:

Current State: The cluster has pods in CrashLoopBackOff—likely leftovers or misconfigs. Example pods: [names].

Expectation: A clean "vanilla" cluster should have no crashing workloads post-repave.

Impact: Crashy pods compete for resources and destabilize core components.

Questions:

Are these crashing pods expected in the base setup? If yes, they need fixes. If no, can we clean them up?

How can we verify stability post-repave in the future?

Let’s align on next steps—happy to sync live if needed.
