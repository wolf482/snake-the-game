I’m pleased to share that the migration from RHDH 1.4 to 1.5 has been successfully completed in both the Dev/Andromeda and Sandbox environments. These environments are now fully operational on RHDH 1.5, and teams can start leveraging the new features and improvements.

Next Steps:
Begin Testing/Development – Please direct your workloads to the updated environments.

Report Issues – If you encounter any unexpected behavior or need assistance, tag me (@YourName) or open a ticket with details (error logs, steps to reproduce, etc.).

Documentation – Ensure you review the [release notes/confluence page] for changes that may impact your workflows.

Support:
For urgent issues, ping me directly on Slack/Teams.

For non-critical items, use JIRA/ServiceNow (include [RHDH 1.5 Migration] in the subject).

Thanks for your collaboration! Let’s ensure a smooth transition.
