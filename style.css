Existing CI/CD Limitations for Orchestrator Workflows

Current CI/CD pipelines and plugins cannot be directly reused for orchestrator/workflow implementations.

Workflows require:

Custom pipeline definitions (different from standard app deployments).

Dependencies mirrored in local Artifactory (not fully available in current setup).

Specialized deployment logic (manual steps currently required).

Environment & Dependency Constraints

Key components (e.g., Orion-backend, CMP-services) are still in Phase 1 development, leading to:

Unstable/incomplete dependencies.

Manual deployment processes as interim solution.

No automated promotion path (DEV → TEST → PROD) for workflows yet.

Impact on Project Timelines

Manual deployments introduce delays in testing and integration.

Dependency readiness affects workflow rollout (some artifacts not yet in Artifactory).

Risk of bottlenecks if platform setup is not aligned with development milestones.
