Weâ€™ve identified a critical issue where OpenShift system processes are consuming memory reserved for applications, causing:

Actual pod usage is low (24-29% on app nodes, 2-18% on infra/etcd)

System processes are using ~70-80% of allocatable memory (see attached)

Result: Nodes show 104-112% memory usage despite apps being under limits

Impact:

Applications cannot use their allocated memory

Risk of unnecessary pod evictions

Request:
Please investigate and:

Adjust system memory reservations

Verify why system usage is so high

Provide a fix to protect app memory

Let me know if you need additional data. This requires urgent attention.
