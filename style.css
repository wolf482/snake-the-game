Hi Team,

I’d like to escalate the need for a full cluster repave due to ongoing instability caused by memory overcommitment. This is directly impacting my ability to progress with the OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator installation (subscription/plan errors), despite minimal resource requirements.

Key Points:

Root Cause: The shared environment is prone to corruption by multiple users, and repaving is the most reliable solution.

Impact: This is now a critical blocker for my deliverables.

Ownership: While we have admin access, the cluster is managed externally, and coordinated action is needed.

Request:

SA Admin Team: Please prioritize repaving to restore stability.

All Users: Share your availability for a maintenance window to minimize disruption.

Let’s align on next steps today—I’m happy to provide logs or join a sync to clarify the urgency.

Thanks,
