Subject: Transition to feature/rhdh1.5.1 & Sandbox Environment Updates

Message:
Team, please use the feature/rhdh1.5.1 branch for all changes in RHDH Dev and Sandbox moving forward.

Key Updates:

Kafka Secrets/Certs: Import in progress—no blockers. Completion notice will follow.

Keycloak: Flip and repave planned soon. Timeline TBD.

Sandbox Deployment:

The manifest must be flipped (Harness currently defaults to 25d and is out of sync).

This is a known issue with Lightspeed support—not a deployment blocker but needs resolution.

12d Early Sandbox:

Will be decommissioned post-repave to reclaim resources.

Action Required: Promote any needed deployments to Dev or a new Sandbox in Dev before decommissioning.

A backup will be taken once confirmed by iLab SA Clusters before shutdown.

If developers need this environment restored post-repave, notify me for a refresh.

Next Steps: Proceed with the above, and reach out with any questions or dependencies.
