Confirmed Approach: Per Chadâ€™s note, this will be rolled out via ACM (Advanced Cluster Management), not manual Changes (CH).

Action for Arun/Neeraj:

No need to create manual Change tickets for UAT/Prod.

Instead, coordinate with the ACM team to ensure the policies/bundles for Keycloak are prepped and scheduled.

Next Steps:

ACM team to confirm the deployment timeline.

Test team to validate post-ACM rollout (no manual installs needed).
