Hi [Team/Names],

I hope the patching is progressing smoothly.

Given the late hour and my limited availability right now, could we:

Keep the RHDH 1.5 application down if any issues arise (rather than attempting immediate fixes).

Defer full validation to my work hours [specify time, e.g., "tomorrow morning at 8 AM ET"]?

This will allow me to:

Thoroughly test the environment with fresh focus

Document any issues systematically

Collaborate with the team during overlapping hours

If urgent action is needed tonight, please flag it to me, and I’ll assist as best I can. Otherwise, I’ll take ownership of validation first thing tomorrow.

Thank you for your support!
