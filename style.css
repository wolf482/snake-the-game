Hi [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for your question regarding the requirements for deploying a serverless application. As outlined in the documentation, the primary requirement is the NetworkPolicy allow-from-openshift-serverless to ensure proper connectivity. Beyond this, no additional configurations are needed for the deployment itself.

For further clarity, I’ve shared the Bitbucket repository link with you, which includes a detailed README outlining the setup process for the serverless use case. You should now have access to the repo—please let me know if you encounter any issues accessing it or if you have further questions.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
