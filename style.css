I wanted to clarify the status of SD-1YG6-K5BN. This issue was resolved some time ago, and the node in question (node 18) was never installed in my LVM environment. The yellow flag in the CVMP portal appears to be a reflection or synchronization issue, as I do not have any Node.js instances running in my setup.

For reference:

I do not have access to the CVMP portal—this falls under your and Rajesh’s purview as managers.

The data feeding from CAS may need to be reviewed or updated to reflect the correct status.

Moving forward, if there are concerns about my work, I’d appreciate direct communication rather than retroactive scrutiny during my planned time off. I’m happy to collaborate to resolve any legitimate issues proactively.

Let me know if you need further details or assistance troubleshooting the CVMP discrepancy.
