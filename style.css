*I understand your concerns about access, but I want to clarify that I created and sent you a Marketplace request ticket 3 days ago via email ([mention email address if needed]). The next step requires you to check your inbox (including spam/junk folders) and follow the instructions in the ticket to complete the process.*

Moving forward, please make sure to check your emails promptly so we can resolve access issues efficiently. Let me know if you need help locating the ticket, and I’d be happy to forward it again. However, the approval process relies on your action—I can’t proceed without your confirmation.

Thanks for your cooperation!"r!
