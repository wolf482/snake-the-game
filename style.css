Hi Arun,

I’ve completed the iLab setup for ISRP certification, and to ensure the ISDP documentation aligns with Citi’s requirements, I’m sharing the following Red Hat references that detail the correct processes for Orchestrator and ServerLogic Operator:

[Link 1: RHDH 1.5 Official Documentation]

[Link 2: Orchestrator Setup Guide] (add actual links)

Key Gaps to Address in the ISDP Document:

Incomplete Sections: The current draft copies generic steps from RHDH without adapting them to our iLab environment or certification needs.

Missing Validations: No evidence of cross-checking against the actual setup (e.g., server logic configurations, error handling).

Action Required: Please revise the document by <insert deadline> with:

Verified steps from the Red Hat links above.

Screenshots/logs from iLab to confirm functionality.

Clear annotations where our setup diverges from standard RHDH.

This is critical for certification, and I’d appreciate your confirmation that you’ll prioritize this. If there are blockers, let’s discuss today.









I hope this email finds you well.

I’ve completed the setup of the iLab environment for the ISRP certification, and as discussed, the next critical step is ensuring the ISDP documentation is accurate and thoroughly reviewed. Upon going through the documents you shared earlier, I noticed several sections that appear to be copied directly from RHDH without further investigation or contextual adjustments for the Orchestrator and ServerLogic Operator components.

To ensure the documentation meets Citi’s certification standards, I’d like to request the following:

Detailed Review: Revisit the ISDP document to verify all technical steps, especially those specific to Orchestrator and ServerLogic Operator, are accurately documented (not just copied).

Gaps Investigation: Address any unclear or missing sections—particularly where the setup diverges from RHDH.

Timeline: Provide an updated version by [insert deadline, e.g., Friday, EOD] so we can proceed without delays.

Given the tight timeline for certification, your proactive attention to this will be highly appreciated. Let me know if you need any clarifications from my side regarding the iLab setup to assist with the documentation.



Hey Josh,

We need the DAGs refreshed to pull data for user, group, and user_sa in the new DB instance OROIN_OCP. I’ve already dumped the user and group data from dev as a temporary fix.

Once that’s done, give us a heads-up so we can restart and test logins for a few users. Also, any ETA on including this new DB in the DAGs?

1. Resource Contention
CPU/Memory Pressure: The repeated crashes and restarts of pods (CrashLoopBackOff) consume additional CPU and memory resources, which could lead to resource starvation for other critical components like the API server or webhooks.

Increased Load on kubelet: The kubelet on each node has to manage the failed pods, adding unnecessary overhead.

2. API Server Overload
Excessive API Calls: Each pod crash and restart triggers reconciliation loops in controllers (e.g., Deployment, ReplicaSet), generating a high volume of API requests to the Kubernetes API server.

etcd Performance Impact: The API server relies on etcd for state storage. Frequent pod failures can lead to increased etcd write/read operations, potentially slowing down cluster-wide operations.

3. Webhook Latency or Failures
Admission Webhook Delays: If the failing pods are part of a webhook service (e.g., a validating/mutating admission controller), their instability could cause:

Timeouts or delays in API requests (e.g., Pod creation, Deployment updates).

Rejected requests if the webhook is unavailable.

Race Conditions: Intermittent webhook availability might lead to inconsistent policy enforcement.

4. Network and Scheduling Overhead
Increased Network Traffic: Repeated pod restarts may trigger additional network calls (e.g., image pulls, service discovery).

Scheduler Load: The Kubernetes scheduler has to reassign the failing pods repeatedly, increasing its workload.

5. Monitoring and Logging Strain
Log Spam: Crash-looping pods generate excessive logs, which can overwhelm logging systems (e.g., Fluentd, Loki, Elasticsearch).

Alert Fatigue: If alerts are configured for pod failures, the constant crashes could flood monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Alertmanager).

Recommended Actions
Debug Pod Failures:

Check logs of the failing pods (kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous).

Verify resource limits and readiness/liveness probes.

Look for misconfigurations in the scanner and ecs-rhacs-secure deployments.

Adjust Resource Allocation:

Increase CPU/memory limits if the pods are being OOM-killed.

Optimize or disable unnecessary probes if they are causing restarts.

Scale Down Problematic Workloads:

Temporarily reduce replica counts for the affected deployments to minimize impact.

Monitor API Server Metrics:

Watch for high latency or error rates in kube-apiserver metrics (e.g., apiserver_request_duration_seconds).

Check for Cluster-Level Issues:

Ensure etcd and control plane components are healthy (kubectl get componentstatuses).
