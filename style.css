Hi Team,

I’ve deployed the new product to UAT as part of the migration I’m leading. Given the long weekend, I’ve included a few team members to assist with monitoring during the deployment.

Next Steps:

The RHDH secrets have been pushed to UAT.

If needed, you can upgrade the annotations to start using the new secrets.

Status Update:

The platform looks good so far for RHDH (tested).

We’re on an aggressive timeline, so please let me know if you encounter any issues.

I’ll post an update once the upgrade is complete. Thanks for your support!
