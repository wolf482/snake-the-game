Hi Brian,

I noticed you weren’t able to make the meeting time I proposed earlier. I completely understand schedules can get hectic!

Would any of these alternative times work for you?

Option 1: [Date + Time]

Option 2: [Date + Time]

Option 3: [Flexible suggestion, e.g., “Or I’m happy to find a time that suits you better.”]

If none of these work, please let me know what works best for your calendar—I’m happy to accommodate. Looking forward to connecting!
