Issue Summary
The Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) currently lacks support for embedded Python modules such as mkdocs-video, causing compilation failures in TechDocs when attempting to render video media content in Markdown. This limitation affects documentation workflows requiring dynamic multimedia integration.

Root Cause Analysis
RHDH’s default containerized environment restricts the installation of third-party Python modules (e.g., mkdocs-video), leading to build errors.

The sole TechDocs component utilizing video content cannot be processed under the current constraints, forcing a fallback to static assets.

Interim Mitigation
To ensure uninterrupted documentation delivery, the following measures have been implemented:

Persistent Volume Allocation:

Enabled pod-specific persistent volumes to facilitate static asset storage (e.g., images) as a temporary alternative to embedded videos.

Ensured backward compatibility with existing TechDocs workflows.

Media Content Adaptation:

Replaced video embeds with static images in the Orion documentation, adhering to RHDH’s current capabilities.

Long-Term Strategic Resolution
TechDocs CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement:

Evaluate and implement a containerized build process for TechDocs, decoupling from RHDH’s runtime constraints.

Leverage OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) to pre-render documentation with required dependencies (e.g., mkdocs-video) in an isolated environment.

Upstream Collaboration:

Engage with the Red Hat Open Innovation Labs team to advocate for native support of multimedia plugins in RHDH’s base image.

Technical Impact & Justification
Risk Mitigation: Persistent volumes ensure data resilience, while static assets maintain usability.

Scalability: Proposed CI/CD integration aligns with GitOps practices, enabling future extensibility for multimedia content.

Compliance: Adheres to Red Hat’s security policies by avoiding ad-hoc module installations in production pods.

Next Steps
Task Ownership: Orion Sprint 57 team to oversee PV utilization and image-based documentation updates.

Architectural Review: Initiate cross-functional discussion with Platform Engineering to formalize the TechDocs CI/CD roadmap.
