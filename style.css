Efficiency & Agility: Currently, only Offshore has access to this group, which creates delays when I need visibility or permissions to troubleshoot migration-related tasks. Having temporary access will allow me to:

Quickly verify configurations or logs during migration.

Resolve issues without dependency bottlenecks.

Ensure smoother coordination between teams.

Risk Mitigation: The access will be strictly limited to the UAT migration timeline ([dates if known]). I propose removing my access immediately after migration completion to maintain security compliance.

Alignment with Project Needs: This aligns with our goal of a seamless migrationâ€”reducing back-and-forth communication and accelerating issue resolution.
