A quick clarification to avoid deployment issues: The 12d sandbox is no longer available for use as part of our migration. All deployments must now target 25d or 001d environments.

Action Items:

If you have any remaining resources or configurations in 12d, migrate them to 25d/001d immediately.

Update CI/CD pipelines, scripts, or documentation referencing 12d to reflect the new environments.

Impact: Deployments targeting 12d will fail, so please verify your setups. Let me know if you need help with the migrationâ€”happy to assist.
