1. Describe the impact to you or the business
Response (4000-character limit):
"This issue significantly impacts user productivity and system usability. When sessions expire without warning, users lose unsaved work or face confusion due to unclear error messages (e.g., 'Failed to load entity kinds'). This leads to repeated login attempts, increased support requests, and disrupted workflows. From a business perspective, the lack of proper session management affects compliance with security best practices (e.g., session timeout policies) and creates a poor user experience, potentially delaying critical development tasks. There is no immediate legal/medical urgency, but resolving this is a priority for maintaining operational efficiency."

2. In what environment are you experiencing this behavior?
Response (3000-character limit):
*"Environment Details:

Product: Red Hat Developer Hub (RHUB)

Version: 1.5

Deployment: [Specify if on-premise, OpenShift, etc.]

Browser: [e.g., Chrome vXX, Firefox vXX]

OS: [e.g., RHEL 8.x, Windows 10]

Authentication: [e.g., Keycloak, OAuth]

The issue occurs consistently across all tested environments when users remain inactive beyond the session timeout period. Session expiration is configured to [X minutes/hours], but no alerts or redirects are triggered."*

3. How frequently does this behavior occur?
Response:
*"This issue occurs repeatedly and predictably:

Frequency: Every time a user’s session expires due to inactivity.

Repro Steps: Log in → remain idle for the session duration → observe error without warning/redirect.

Pattern: Not tied to specific times but depends on inactivity. Affects all users with active sessions."*
