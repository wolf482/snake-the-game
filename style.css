ollowing the recent repave of our 12d OpenShift cluster, Iâ€™ve observed several issues indicating that the process may not have completed cleanly. Multiple pods are in a CrashLoopBackOff state, and some critical components appear degraded. This instability could lead to:

Degraded cluster performance (slow API responses, application timeouts)

Potential data inconsistencies (due to failing operators or storage issues)

Increased risk of outages (if core services remain unstable)
