Investigated discrepancies in Backstage entity synchronization via Airflow DAGs and Bitbucket repos. Observed delays in entity updates (additions/deletions) not aligning with the configured period in AP config. Proposed solution: Leverage Citi Common Backend process in the Dev environment to sync and process entities, mirroring the initial Backstage deployment. Testing is underway in the Sandbox (25D RHDH instance). Shifted approach from AP config to a custom RHDH plugin for more reliable entity processing.
