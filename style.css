Root Cause:
Users were being prematurely logged out due to short-lived authentication tokens expiring during active sessions.

Solution Implemented:
Increased the JWT token lifetime in Keycloak authentication settings to maintain stable sessions while preserving security:

Adjusted Access Token Lifespan from X minutes to Y hours

Configured Refresh Token Lifespan to Z hours

Verified session persistence matches business requirements

Validation Steps:

Monitor user sessions for 24+ hours

Confirm no unexpected logouts during active use

Verify token expiration timestamps align with new settings

Additional Notes:
While this resolves the immediate issue, we should schedule a review of optimal token expiration balances between security and usability.
