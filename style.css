"Thank you for the update, Katerina. I understand the need to open a ticket to track this issue properly. For context, I was anticipating we'd have until the end of the week to investigate whether this could be resolved without formal ticketing, as we were exploring potential quick resolutions.

Could we align on timelines? I'd still like to complete our current investigation by [date] to determine if we can resolve this without additional processes. If we haven't found a solution by then, we can proceed with opening the ticket immediately.

Would this approach work for you and your senior colleague? I'm happy to discuss further if needed."
