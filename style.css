Hi Amit,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my leave request sent on [date], as I haven’t received confirmation yet. Given that Neeraj (Associate Director) will be transitioning out on July 15, I need to ensure approvals are finalized before his departure to avoid delays.

As you know, I’ve consistently contributed to the team—often extending hours and delivering beyond expectations. With [X years] at the company, I’ve earned this time to address personal priorities, and I’ve planned these leaves accordingly.

Action Needed: Kindly approve the request at the earliest or let me know if there are any concerns to address. I’d appreciate confirmation by [specific deadline, e.g., July 12] to ensure smooth handovers.

Thanks for your understanding.
