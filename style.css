Root Cause:

The cluster issues are not due to inefficient resource handling by your team.

The degraded state is caused by:

Aqua Security webhooks failing (external component you don’t control).

Encryption migration (normal cluster operation, not your workload).

Action Plan:

Escalate to the security team (owners of Aqua) to fix or remove the failing webhooks (imageassurance.aquasec.com).

Document: Share this analysis with OpenShift support to clarify:

The API server errors are from Aqua, not your apps.

Encryption migration is a platform process, unrelated to your team.

Key Message to Support:
"The degraded state is unrelated to our workloads. The issues stem from external components (Aqua) and cluster maintenance tasks. Please coordinate with the security team for resolution."

No action is required from your team on pod/resource cleanup—this is a red herring. Focus on getting the right owners (Aqua/security) engaged.
