Hi Support Team,

Weâ€™re seeing unusually high memory usage on two OpenShift nodes (app-0 and app-1):

oc adm top nodes shows 112% and 104% memory usage (exceeding limits).

But pods alone only use ~75-85% of allocatable memory.

This suggests ~30-40% of memory is being used by system processes, which seems excessive.

Request: Could you investigate:

Why system memory usage is so high?

If this is normal or needs fixing?

Example (app-0):

Allocatable: 16,634Mi

Pods: 12,536Mi (75%)

System: ~6,195Mi (37%)

Total: 112%

Let us know if you need more details. Thanks!
