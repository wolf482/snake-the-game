Hi Mohammed,

Thank you for reaching out. I’d be happy to assist with developing the test cases for the serverless logic. While I’m currently juggling a few tasks, I’ll prioritize this to ensure we stay on track.

To get started, I’ll coordinate with Brian to align on testing requirements and timelines. Brian, could we set up a quick sync to discuss the scope, priorities, and any existing test frameworks we can leverage? Let me know your availability over the next few days.

Mohammed, please feel free to share any additional context or expectations you’d like us to consider.

Looking forward to progressing on this!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
