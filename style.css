Hi [Admin's Name],

To isolate the issue, I confirmed that the same CatalogSource/Operator installs successfully in other clusters. This suggests the problem is environment-specific, likely due to:

OLM or cluster-level instability (memory contention, corrupted state).

Subscription conflicts unique to this cluster.

Impact:

This is now a critical blocker for [project/deadline].

Manual troubleshooting (e.g., OLM reset) or repaving remains the fastest resolution path.

Request:
Since you have deeper cluster access, could you either:

Attempt the installation yourself (to rule out permission/resource issues)?

Escalate to the infrastructure team for immediate inspection?

Iâ€™m happy to provide logs or compare configurations. Let me know how we can prioritize this.
