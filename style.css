The RHDH product handles RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) at the application layer, providing granular permissions and audit logging for all SonataWorkflow endpoints. This means:

Access control to workflow orchestration functionality is managed entirely within RHDH's built-in RBAC system

All API endpoint accesses are audited through RHDH's logging mechanisms

For the operator installation itself:

This is indeed a basic standalone operator deployment

No additional RBAC configuration is required at the Kubernetes/OpenShift level

Network access to the orchestrator is restricted by OpenShift Network Policies, providing an additional layer of security at the platform level

The operator's default RBAC configuration is sufficient as all permission management flows through RHDH's centralized access control system. This design maintains security while simplifying the operator deployment.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect of this architecture.
