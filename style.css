Hi Kuldeep,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m following up to confirm the timeline for the repave of the cluster (RHDH/Keycloak), as we haven’t received an update since the initial go-ahead was confirmed.

Our team is ready to test immediately post-repave and is eager to proceed. Given that the original target was earlier this week, could you:

Confirm if there are any outstanding blockers or dependencies from your side?

Share the revised schedule—ideally targeting tomorrow (or ASAP) if feasible?

We’d appreciate advance notice once the cluster is available for validation to align our testing efforts. Please let us know if any additional details are needed from our end to expedite this.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,
Yon
