Moving forward, anyone who needs access to [system/tool] must submit a CMP request for the AD group: [Group Name].

No exceptions—this is the standard process.

I will not manually handle access requests while I’m on leave or otherwise unavailable.

If you haven’t submitted a request, you don’t have access—no more excuses.

If you’re blocked, check your email for approval links or follow up with the IT/access team—not me.

This ensures fairness and accountability. Let’s all take responsibility for our own access needs.

Thanks,
