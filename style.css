Hi ddd,

The package in question has already been removed from the Linux host (evidence attached). However, the report appears to pull data from an external system or dddd that I don’t manage.

To resolve this efficiently:

Can we use this evidence to close the ticket, or does it strictly require updates in the report’s source?

The discrepancy suggests the report isn’t reflecting the latest state—we’ve addressed the issue, but the data source may need synchronization.

Our team is investigating how this report is generated to identify the mismatch. Let me know how you’d like to proceed.
