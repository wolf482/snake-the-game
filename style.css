Thank you for following up. To ensure we address this efficiently, could you clarify:

Who will own the ticket? (Is this for your team, my team, or another group?)

What is the expected action? (e.g., correction in the report’s data source, CMDB update, or validation of our evidence?)

Is there a specific process or team that manages discrepancies in this report?

Our team has already removed the package (evidence attached), so we want to align on whether the ticket should focus on:

The reporting system’s data sync, or

Formal closure of the finding via our provided evidence.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed—I’m happy to assist or connect with the right stakeholders.
